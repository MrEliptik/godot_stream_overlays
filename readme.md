# Godot Streaming Overlays

⚠️ Everything is subject to change as I'm actively working on it! ⚠️

This is a collection of various overlays, made for streaming, with Godot! I'm making them live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mreliptik)

## Projects

### Characters overlay

Similar to [Stream avatars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/665300/Stream_Avatars/) where you have characters on screen, representing your current viewers.

### Facecam overlay

An overlay made to replace your webcam. You can use different images (mouth open/closed) to change based on the mic input.

### Spectrum analyzer

Using the microphone (or any other audio stream) display a spectrum analyzer (frequency analysis).

### Ridiculous Coding

Turn the [Ridiculous Coding](https://github.com/jotson/ridiculous_coding) addon into an overlay, using websockets to communicate between the editor and the transparent windows (overlay).

### Alerts Overlay

A dashboard with button acts as a websocket server. An overlay connects to the server and will receive inputs based on the button pressed, triggering effects. Perfect to trigger alerts or custom events/effects.

## HOW TO USE

Each project is using a transparent window, so you can set it to the size you want and capture it with your streaming software. 

- For example with OBS, just setup a "Game Capture" source, and check "Allow Transparency" and voilà!

*TODO: Add specific directions for each projects*
